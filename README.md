# login with client side validation

This login form is a user interface that allows users to enter their name , lastname, email and password in order to be able to login to a website . It's create using HTML element such as text inputs , buttons ,image , and styles using CSS .JavaScript would then be used to perform client-side validation on the form data, checking that the entered field meet certain criteria (e.g. minimum length, correct format,name field should not be empty) before being submitted to the server for further processing . The use of Boostrap ensures that the page is responsive .

## Additional functionality

The option to show or hide the password adds an extra layer of security by allowing the user to hide their password from prying eyes. It also makes the password input process more convenient for the user, as they can toggle the visibility of their password as needed
